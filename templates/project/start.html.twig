		<p>Hello there! There is a student who has failed the Database course and think he's 
		been graded wrongfully. He wants revenge and has locked himself inside the serverroom.
		He plans to load a script that erases everyone's work...
	<br>
		If you want to help we must stop him before it's too late! I've already tried to get into the
		serverroom but it's locked.. You need to find a way in.</p>
